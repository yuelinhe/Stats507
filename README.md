# Stats507

The repository contains the work Iâ€™ve done in the course Statistics 507, Fall 2021, at Umich.

## [ps2_q3.ipynb](ps2_q3.ipynb) is a notebook containing my code from PS2, Question 3.

It uses Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Data files, including demographic datasets and oral health and dentition data for four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018, can be found in the folder [Data_ps2_q3](Data_ps2_q3).
